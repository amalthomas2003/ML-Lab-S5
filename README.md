Problems are numbered based on below questions

```
Explore Graphical Plots in R.
Experiment No.3: Create a Scatter plot with the iris dataset using the ggplot package. Add
legends, lines, and labels, and use the aes function in the plot.


Experiment No.4: Create a histogram with the titanic dataset using the ggplot package. Add
legends, lines, and labels, and use the aes function in the plot.
Classification


Experiment No.5: Demonstrate pre-processing in soyabean dataset using R, with
minimum of four preprocessing to be done, and prepare it for classification.
